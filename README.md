# SpectraNoise
SpectraNoise is a Max for Live device designed by Stephen Black (Supertramp162) that generates evolving spectrums of noise to generate evolving, spectrally-rich noise textures that integrate musically with Ableton Live’s tempo and stereo field.

Rather than behaving like a static noise generator, SpectraNoise shapes noise content dynamically across the frequency spectrum, allowing it to breathe, shift, and animate over time. It’s intended for sound designers, electronic musicians, and experimental producers looking to add movement, texture, and controlled chaos to their sounds.

## Features

- **Spectral Noise Generation**  
  Noise is distributed and shaped across multiple frequency bands, allowing for focused or wide-range textures rather than flat broadband noise.

- **Tempo-Synced Motion**  
  Internal modulation and movement stages can be locked to Ableton Live’s tempo for rhythmic or slowly evolving results.

- **Stereo Animation**  
  Subtle stereo movement creates depth and spatial interest without overpowering the source material.

- **Texture Shaping**  
  Controls for intensity, spectral balance, and movement allow SpectraNoise to range from delicate atmospheres to aggressive digital textures.

## Use Cases

- Adding evolving texture to pads and drones  
- Creating noise layers for techno, ambient, or experimental music  
- Enhancing percussive elements with controlled spectral grit  
- Generative or sound-design-focused workflows  

SpectraNoise works particularly well when placed after sustained or harmonically rich material, but it can also be used creatively on drums and transient sources.
